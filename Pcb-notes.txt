Component Connections
Power Supply (VCC and GND)

Connect the VCC net to:
VDD pins of both DACs (MCP4725).
VCC pins of both op-amps (LM358).
Connect the GND net to:
VSS pins of both DACs.
GND pins of both op-amps.
Second pin of both shunt resistors.
DACs (MCP4725)

Connect the I2C SDA and SCL pins of the DACs to Arduino's I2C pins (A4 for SDA, A5 for SCL).
For the hour hand DAC:
Connect OUT to the non-inverting input (IN+) of the hour op-amp.
For the minute hand DAC:
Connect OUT to the non-inverting input (IN+) of the minute op-amp.
Op-Amps (LM358)

For the hour op-amp:
Connect OUT to the gate of the MOSFET (hour).
Connect the inverting input (IN-) to the first terminal of the hour shunt resistor.
For the minute op-amp:
Connect OUT to the gate of the MOSFET (minute).
Connect the inverting input (IN-) to the first terminal of the minute shunt resistor.
MOSFETs

For the hour MOSFET:
Drain (D) connects to the hour gauge’s terminal.
Source (S) connects to the first terminal of the hour shunt resistor.
For the minute MOSFET:
Drain (D) connects to the minute gauge’s terminal.
Source (S) connects to the first terminal of the minute shunt resistor.
Shunt Resistors

Use 
82
 
Ω
82Ω resistors for both hour and minute hands.
Connect:
One side of each shunt resistor to the source of the corresponding MOSFET.
The other side of each shunt resistor to GND.
Gauges

Connect the first terminal of each gauge to the drain of its corresponding MOSFET.
Connect the second terminal of each gauge to the VCC power supply.
Buttons

Each button has two terminals:
Connect one terminal of the hour button to Arduino pin 2.
Connect the other terminal of the hour button to GND.
Connect one terminal of the minute button to Arduino pin 3.
Connect the other terminal of the minute button to GND.
